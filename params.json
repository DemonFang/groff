The version\r\nnumber is given in the file VERSION.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this release are implementations of `troff', `pic', `eqn',\r\n`tbl', `grn', `refer', `-man', `-mdoc', `-mom', and `-ms' macros, and\r\ndrivers for `PostScript', `TeX dvi' format, `HP LaserJet 4' printers,\r\n`Canon CAPSL' printers, `HTML' and `XHTML' formats (beta status), and\r\ntypewriter-like devices.  Also included is a modified version of the\r\nBerkeley `-me' macros, the enhanced version `gxditview' of the X11\r\n`xditview' previewer, and an implementation of the `-mm' macros\r\ncontributed by Joergen Haegg (jh@axis.se).\r\n\r\nSee the file `INSTALL' for installation instructions.  You require\r\na C++ compiler.\r\n\r\nThe file `NEWS' describes recent user-visible changes to `groff'.\r\n\r\n`groff' is free software.  See the file `COPYING' for copying\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nThe file `PROBLEMS' describes various problems that have been\r\nencountered in compiling, installing, and running `groff'.\r\n\r\nThe file `MORE.STUFF' contains information about add-on packages\r\nuseful for groff.\r\n\r\nThe most recent released version of `groff' is always available by\r\nanonymous ftp from `ftp.gnu.org' in the directory `gnu/groff'.\r\n\r\nThe current development version of `groff' is available from a `CVS'\r\nrepository.  You can access it by first selecting a parent directory\r\nin which to create a working copy (call it, say, `~/cvswork'), and\r\nthen executing the commands\r\n\r\n  cd ~/cvswork\r\n  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org/sources/groff -z5 co groff\r\n\r\nThis creates a subdirectory, `~/cvswork/groff', with a `checked\r\nout' copy of the `CVS' repository.  An update of this working copy may\r\nbe achieved, at any later time by invoking the commands\r\n\r\n  cd ~/cvswork/groff\r\n  cvs -z5 update -dP\r\n\r\nPlease read the `CVS' info pages for further details.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is possible to access the `CVS' with a web browser by\r\npointing it to\r\n\r\n  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=groff\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can download snapshots (which are updated twice a day).\r\nThe complete `groff' source as a single file is available at\r\n\r\n  http://groff.ffii.org/groff/devel/groff-current.tar.gz\r\n\r\nA diff file relative to `groff-<version>', the latest official `groff'\r\nrelease is available at\r\n\r\n  http://groff.ffii.org/groff/devel/groff-<version>-current.diff.gz\r\n\r\nAssuming that `groff-<version>.tar.gz' and\r\n`groff-<version>-current.diff.gz' are in the same directory, do the\r\nfollowing to apply the diff file:\r\n\r\n  tar xzvf groff-<version>.tar.gz\r\n  cd groff-<version>\r\n  gunzip -c ../groff-<version>-current.diff.gz | patch -p1\r\n\r\nDepending on your requirements, you may need at least some of the\r\nfollowing tools to build `groff' directly from its source:\r\n\r\n  ghostscript\r\n  the psutils package\r\n  the netpbm package\r\n  texinfo 4.8\r\n  bison >= 1.875b or byacc\r\n\r\nNote that `texinfo' and `bison' or `byacc' are required only for\r\nbuilding from `CVS' sources (either a checked out working copy, or a\r\ndaily snapshot).  They are not required for building from a stable\r\nrelease tarball.  Also note that the version numbers stated are the\r\nminimum supported.  No version of `texinfo' < 4.8 works, and the\r\noriginal release of `bison' 1.875 is known not to work; you *may* find\r\nthat `bison' releases < 1.875 work, but in case of difficulty,\r\nplease update to a later version *before* posting a bug report.\r\n\r\nFor *all* sources, you need ghostscript for creation of either `PDF' or\r\n`HTML' output; the `netpbm' and `psutils' packages are required only for\r\n`HTML' output.  If you don't intend to produce output in either of these\r\nformats, then these packages are unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn Linux Debian, the installation of `texinfo' is dangerous.  For it\r\ncreates a file `install-info' that blocks the system installation.\r\nSo the created `/usr/local/bin/install-info' must be renamed.\r\n\r\nThe `groff' configure script searches for the X11 headers and\r\nlibraries `Xaw' and `Xmu'.  So the corresponding developer packages of\r\nyour system must be installed, otherwise `groff' does not install\r\n`gxditview' and the `-TX*' devices.  In Debian, the developer packages\r\nare `libxaw7-dev' and `libxmu-dev'.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs using the form in the file `BUG-REPORT'; the idea of\r\nthis is to make sure that FSF has all the information it needs to fix\r\nthe bug.  At the very least, read the `BUG-REPORT' form and make sure\r\nthat you supply all the information that it asks for.  Even if you are\r\nnot sure that something is a bug, report it using `BUG-REPORT': this\r\nenables us to determine whether it really is a bug or not.\r\n\r\nThree mailing lists are available:\r\n\r\n  bug-groff@gnu.org          for reporting bugs\r\n  groff@gnu.org              for general discussion of groff\r\n  groff-commit@gnu.org       a read-only list showing commitments\r\n                             to the CVS repository\r\n\r\nTo subscribe, send a mail to <list>-request@<domain> (example:\r\ngroff-request@gnu.org for the `groff' list) with the word `subscribe'\r\nin either the subject or body of the email (don't include the quotes).\r\nAlternatively, you may subscribe by visiting the web pages at\r\n\r\n  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-groff\r\n  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/groff\r\n  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/groff-commit\r\n\r\nEach of these web pages also provides a link to a browseable archive of\r\npostings to the corresponding mailing list.\r\n\r\nGNU `groff' was written by James Clark <jjc@jclark.com>.
